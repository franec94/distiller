\frametitle{Experiments Design}
We decided to organize and design our experiments following a strict and precise series of subsequent steps that allow us to break down the different targets and goals
we identified for accomplishing the case study we want to pursue. In particular we proceed in the following manner:

\begin{itemize}

\item Firstly, we selected the \textbf{\textit{computing tools}} by means of which we were able to produce, collect and show meaingful results and insights about different trials.
\item Then, we identified \textbf{\textit{input target image}} that will represent our target image as well as training set, that should be compressed using some kind of compression technique
for Deep Nets.
\item We created ahead of compressing time, both \textit{Jpeg and Plain Siren datasets} that have made up our \textbf{\textit{control group}} against which comparing later
should be made taking into account compressed counter part models.

\end{itemize}
