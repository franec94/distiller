Main reasons that fluctuate around development and employment  of Siren Deep Neural Network Models, as reported by related research work describe in the corresponding publication:
\begin{itemize}
\item Implicitly defined, continuous, differentiable signal representations parameterized by neural networks have emerged as a powerful paradigm, offering many possible 
benefits over conventional representations.
\item  However, current network architectures for such implicit neural representations are incapable of modeling signals with fine detail, and fail to represent
a signalâ€™s spatial and temporal derivatives, despite the fact that these are essential to many physical signals defined implicitly as the solution to partial differential equations.
\end{itemize}
