The major contributes we can read of from Siren's research paper that have been produced to justify architecture itself existence are:

\begin{itemize}
\item as Siren paper's authors say, We are interested in a class of functions $\Phi$ that satisfy equations of the form:

\begin{align}
F(x, \Phi, \nabla_{x}\Phi, \nabla_{x}_{x}^{2}\Phi, \dots) = 0, \Phi:x\rightarrow\Phi(x)
\end{align}
\item 
\item 
\end{itemize}
