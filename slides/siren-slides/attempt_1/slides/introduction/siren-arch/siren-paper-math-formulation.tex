\frametitle{Math Formulation of Siren Architectures}
Speaking briefly about essential math details about Siren Deep Neural Net architectures, we can say that these precise kind of models are mathematically formuled as follow:

\begin{itemize}
\item as Siren paper's authors say, We are interested in a class of functions $\Phi$ that satisfy equations of the form: 
\begin{equation}
F(x, \Phi, \nabla_{x}\Phi, \nabla_{x}^{2}\Phi, \dots) = 0, \Phi:x\rightarrow\Phi(x)
\end{equation}
\item This implicit problem formulation takes as input the spatial or spatio-temporal coordinates $x \in R^{m}$ and, optionally, derivatives of $\Phi$ with respect to these coordinates. Our goal is then to learn a neuralnetwork that parameterizes $\Phi$ to map $x$ to some quantity of interest while satisfying the constraintpresented in Equation (1).
\item Thus, $\Phi$ is implicitly defined by the relation defined by $F$ and we refer to neural networks that parameterize such implicitly defined functions as \textit{implicit neural representations}.
\end{itemize}
