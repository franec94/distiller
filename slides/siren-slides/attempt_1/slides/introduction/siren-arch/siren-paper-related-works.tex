Speaking briefly about essential related works cited within Siren's study, we can mention, reading the paper itself, the following earlier researches:

\begin{itemize}
\item They report that recent work has demonstrated the potential of fully connectednetworks as continuous, memory-efficient implicit representations for shape parts, objects or scenes.
\item Also, they claimed that in previous works in addition to representingshape, some of these models have been extended to also encode object appearance, which can be trained using (multiview) 2D image data using neural rendering.
\end{itemize}
