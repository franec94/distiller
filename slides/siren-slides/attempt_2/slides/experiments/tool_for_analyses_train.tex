\frametitle{Tools Used for Train and Create Reports}
Here, we report the principal tool we decide to use and employ to carry out both training phase of different models as well as producing resulting graphics showing major details we care of. In particular:

\begin{itemize}
\item For training Deep Neural Network models we made use of \textbf{\textit{Distiller IntelLab framework}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item it has been created exploiting \textbf{\textit{Pytorch} Deep Learning Framework}, that employes \textbf{\textit{torch core module as back-end engine}} for dealing with both tensor,
i.e. multidimensional arrays of values, as well as computing procedur for tackling back-propagating algorithm
\item it was extended when necessary to accomodate specific tasks we designed for accomplishing our analyses.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textit{Mathplotlin, Seaborn, Numpy and Pandas}} - computing and graphics tools for dealing with post training results investigation and producing interesting
charts or graphics for creating final reports. These libraries and python modules have been employed also for constructing distinct datasets for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Jpeg, Plain Siren architectures, Pruned and Quantized models datasets.
\item Creating temporary \textit{.csv} file for recording hyper-params setting to be tested or already trained, as our \textbf{\textit{database back-end}}.
\end{itemize}


\end{itemize}
