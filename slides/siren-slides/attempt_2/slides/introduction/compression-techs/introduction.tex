\frametitle{Compression Techniques}

\textbf{Deep Neural Network Models Compression Techniques} can be devided into a given number of different classes or categories depending on the approaches they follow. In particular we can devide such methods, without the claim of being for sure exhaustive but at least quite accurate, as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item Pushing state-of-the-art models on salient tasks within domanins as \textbf{Computer Vision, NLP} corresponds to models becoming larger, increasing \textbf{Memory and Storage Requirements} at both computation and storing time.

\item Bigger models lead to \textbf{Larger Carbon Footprint}, where this issue follows also from observation just done above.

\item Other issues araise when we are attempting to deploy state-of-the-art models within those contexts where we find ourselves constrained by computing limited resources, as well as, reduced amount of battery capability as for \textbf{Mobile Applications and IoT Devices}.

\end{itemize}
