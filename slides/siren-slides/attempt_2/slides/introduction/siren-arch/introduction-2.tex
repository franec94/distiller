Main reasons that fluctuate around development and employment  of Siren Deep Neural Network Models, as reported by related research work describe in the corresponding publication:
\begin{itemize}
\item Proposed to leverage periodic activation functions for implicit neural representations and demonstrating that these networks, dubbed sinusoidal representation networks or \textit{SIRENs}, are ideally suited for repre-senting complex natural signals and their derivatives.
\item Motivated by the discrete cosinetransform, Klocek et al. leverage cosine activation functions for image representation but they do not study the derivatives of these representations or other applications explored in Siren Models.
\end{itemize}
