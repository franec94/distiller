\frametitle{Siren Deep Neural Network Architectures}
Main characteristics of Siren based Deep Models employed for as major purpose of implicitly representing input processed image:
\begin{itemize}
\item It belongs to \textbf{MLP family} of Deep Learning Networks, this means that It resembles a Fully Connected Architecture;
\item It employes as non-linear activation function a \textbf{trigonometric sine function}.
\item It is feeded by means of a set of \textbf{input coordinates} throught which \textbf{output pixel value}, in other words pixel magnitude, in a given scale and so range of values is predicted;
\item It does not employes a well-known and widespread weigths initialization technique as \textbf{\emph{Xavier Initialization}} but instead decided to adopt a \textbf{\emph{Custom Uniform Initialization}}, as described within the same Siren paper.
\end{itemize}
