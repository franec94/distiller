\frametitle{Periodic Nonlinearities Earlier Studies}
While looking at preivous done researches about employing periodic nonlinearities, within Siren paper we can learn about the following facts:

\begin{itemize}
\item Firstly, that \textit{Periodic Nonlinearities} have been investigated repeatedly over the past decades, but have so far failed to robustly outperform alternative activation functions
\item  Early work includes \textit{Fourier neural networks}, engineered to mimic the Fourier transform via single-hidden-layer networks
\item Other work explores neural networks with periodic activations for simpleclassification tasks. It has been shown that suchmodels have universal function approximation properties.
\item Compositional pattern producing networks also  leverage  periodic  nonlinearities,  but  rely  on  a  combination  of  different nonlinearities via evolution in a genetic algorithm framework.
\end{itemize}
