\frametitle{Jpeg Dataset}
For producing jpeg data examples with which we have filled jpeg dataset as part of control group along with data points representing plain Siren like trained models, e.i., not compressed architectures.
In particular, we have compressed target cropped camera image in the following manner:
\begin{itemize}
\item Quality tested within range going from 20\% up to 95\% for quality tuned setting.
\item Dividing overall calculated compression images into three distinct groups that are low, mid and high quality classes, describe as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\textit{low quality}} -  data examples calculated setting a quality score lower than or equal to 50\%;
		\item \textbf{\textit{mid quality}} -  data examples calculated setting a quality score comprised between 50\% ad 80\% value;
		\item \textbf{\textit{high quality}} -  data examples calculated setting a quality score greater than or equal to 80\%.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
