    \frametitle{Compression Techniques}

    \textbf{Deep Neural Network Models Compression Techniques} have been studied from many years, and are now a day in ever high demand due to several reasons
        which can be summerized in the following:

        \begin{itemize}

            \item Pushing state-of-the-art models on salient tasks within domanins as \textbf{Computer Vision, NLP} corresponds to models becoming larger,
                increasing \textbf{Memory and Storage Requirements} at both computation and storing time.

            \item Bigger models lead to \textbf{Larger Carbon Footprint}, where this issue follows also from observation just done above.

            \item Other issues araise when we are attempting to deploy state-of-the-art models within those contexts where we find ourselves
                constrained by computing limited resources, as well as, reduced amount of battery capability
                as for \textbf{Mobile Applications and IoT Devices}.

    \end{itemize}
