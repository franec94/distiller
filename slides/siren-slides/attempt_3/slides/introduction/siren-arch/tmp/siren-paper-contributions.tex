\frametitle{Principal Siren's Paper Contributions}
The major contributes we can read of from Siren's research paper that have been produced to justify architecture itself existence are:

\begin{itemize}
\item A continuous implicit neural representation using periodic activation functions that fits complicated signals, such as natural images and 3D shapes, and their derivatives robustly.
\item An initialization scheme for training these representations and validation that distributionsof these representations can be learned using hypernetworks.
\item Demonstration of applications in:  image, video, and audio representation; 3D shape re-construction; solving first-order differential equations that aim at estimating a signal bysupervising only with its gradients; and solving second-order differential equations.
\end{itemize}
